# simple_library
Practice project based on JSON, HTTP, REST..

## Cloning
You can clone my repo using:

```
git clone https://github.com/TRedzepagic/simple_library.git
```
in the terminal.

This program was done to practice REST functionality.
It keeps a non-persistent "library" (map) of books for the "bookstore".
I have used JSON to encode information and you can use cURL or Postman to test the server out.

## To-Do
- Add database (Added via https://github.com/TRedzepagic/simple_website, check it out)
