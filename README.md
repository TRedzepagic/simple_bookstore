# simple_bookstore
Another practice project, based on JSON, HTTP, REST..

## Cloning
You can clone my repo using:

```
git clone https://github.com/TRedzepagic/simple_bookstore.git
```
in the terminal.

This program is based on the http.listenandserve functionality. It keeps a non-persistent "library" (map) of books for the "bookstore". This program was done to practice REST functionality.
